## Prompt


I have a CSV file of  email addresses, each of which is associated with a Google Drive account, and a group name (e.g. group01, group02, etc.).

I want to write some Python code that will create a folder on Google Drive for each of these groups, inside a base folder called "Projects".   I want the code to then give each email addresses read/write access to each folder that was created.

I then want a CSV that has a list of each students email address in column 1, their group name in column 2, and a link to their Google Drive folder in column three.

Please help me to set up the necessary Google API credentials and write the necessary python code.


## Results

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Set up Google Drive API Access

* Go to the Google Cloud Console:
    * Create a new project or use an existing one.
* Enable the Google Drive API:
    * In the left menu, go to APIs & Services > Library.
    * Search for Google Drive API and enable it.
* Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials:
    * Go to APIs & Services > Credentials.
    * Click Create Credentials > OAuth client ID.
    * Choose Desktop App or Web Application (for local scripts, Desktop is fine).
    * Download the JSON credentials file and rename it to something like credentials.json.
* Install the required Python libraries:

```
pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib pandas
```

## ‚úÖ Step 2: Python Script

This script does the following:

* Reads a CSV with columns: email, group
* Creates a folder for each group (if it doesn't already exist) inside a parent folder ("Projects")
* Shares each folder with the relevant students
* Exports a new CSV with folder links

```python
import pandas as pd
import os
import json
from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials
from google_auth_oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow
from googleapiclient.discovery import build

# Define the required scopes
SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive']

# Authenticate and build the Drive API service
def authenticate():
    creds = None
    if os.path.exists('token.json'):
        creds = Credentials.from_authorized_user_file('token.json', SCOPES)
    if not creds or not creds.valid:
        if creds and creds.expired and creds.refresh_token:
            creds.refresh(Request())
        else:
            flow = InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file('credentials.json', SCOPES)
            creds = flow.run_local_server(port=0)
        with open('token.json', 'w') as token:
            token.write(creds.to_json())
    return build('drive', 'v3', credentials=creds)

# Create a folder and return its ID
def create_folder(service, name, parent_id=None):
    query = f"name='{name}' and mimeType='application/vnd.google-apps.folder'"
    if parent_id:
        query += f" and '{parent_id}' in parents"
    results = service.files().list(q=query, spaces='drive', fields='files(id, name)').execute()
    folders = results.get('files', [])
    if folders:
        return folders[0]['id']
    metadata = {
        'name': name,
        'mimeType': 'application/vnd.google-apps.folder',
        'parents': [parent_id] if parent_id else []
    }
    folder = service.files().create(body=metadata, fields='id').execute()
    return folder['id']

# Share folder with email
def share_folder(service, file_id, email):
    permission = {
        'type': 'user',
        'role': 'writer',
        'emailAddress': email
    }
    service.permissions().create(
        fileId=file_id,
        body=permission,
        fields='id',
        sendNotificationEmail=False
    ).execute()

def main():
    service = authenticate()

    df = pd.read_csv('input.csv')  # CSV with columns: email, group
    df['folder_link'] = ''

    # Step 1: Create the parent "Projects" folder
    parent_folder_id = create_folder(service, 'Projects')

    # Step 2: Create group folders and assign permissions
    group_folders = {}

    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        email, group = row['email'], row['group']
        if group not in group_folders:
            group_id = create_folder(service, group, parent_folder_id)
            group_folders[group] = group_id
        else:
            group_id = group_folders[group]
        
        share_folder(service, group_id, email)

        folder_link = f"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/{group_id}"
        df.at[index, 'folder_link'] = folder_link

    # Step 3: Export updated CSV
    df.to_csv('output_with_links.csv', index=False)
    print("Done. Output saved to 'output_with_links.csv'.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```


### ‚úÖ Step 3: Folder Structure on Drive

The script will create:

```
Projects/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ group01/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ group02/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ group03/
```

Each folder is shared with the respective students based on their group membership.

## Additiionl Prompt

Can you add a second script that works with the same framework, but will copy all of the files from a folder called "Initial Contents" that is inside the "Projects" folder into each of the other folders?

### Response

Absolutely! Here‚Äôs a second script that uses the same authentication framework and builds on the existing Drive folder structure. This script will:

1. Look for a folder named "Initial Contents" inside the "Projects" folder.
2. Copy all files from "Initial Contents" into each group folder inside "Projects".

```python
from googleapiclient.errors import HttpError

def find_folder_id(service, name, parent_id=None):
    """Find a folder by name and optionally parent folder ID."""
    query = f"name='{name}' and mimeType='application/vnd.google-apps.folder'"
    if parent_id:
        query += f" and '{parent_id}' in parents"
    results = service.files().list(q=query, spaces='drive', fields='files(id, name)').execute()
    folders = results.get('files', [])
    return folders[0]['id'] if folders else None

def list_files_in_folder(service, folder_id):
    """List files in a folder."""
    results = service.files().list(
        q=f"'{folder_id}' in parents and trashed = false",
        spaces='drive',
        fields='files(id, name)'
    ).execute()
    return results.get('files', [])

def copy_file(service, file_id, new_name, parent_id):
    """Copy a file into a new folder."""
    copied_file = {
        'name': new_name,
        'parents': [parent_id]
    }
    return service.files().copy(fileId=file_id, body=copied_file).execute()

def copy_initial_contents_to_groups():
    service = authenticate()

    # Step 1: Find the Projects folder
    projects_id = find_folder_id(service, 'Projects')
    if not projects_id:
        raise Exception("Projects folder not found.")

    # Step 2: Find the 'Initial Contents' folder inside Projects
    initial_id = find_folder_id(service, 'Initial Contents', parent_id=projects_id)
    if not initial_id:
        raise Exception("'Initial Contents' folder not found inside 'Projects'.")

    # Step 3: Get list of all group folders (excluding 'Initial Contents')
    folders = service.files().list(
        q=f"'{projects_id}' in parents and mimeType='application/vnd.google-apps.folder' and name != 'Initial Contents'",
        fields='files(id, name)'
    ).execute().get('files', [])

    # Step 4: Get files to copy
    files_to_copy = list_files_in_folder(service, initial_id)

    if not files_to_copy:
        print("No files found in 'Initial Contents' to copy.")
        return

    # Step 5: Copy files to each group folder
    for folder in folders:
        group_name = folder['name']
        group_id = folder['id']
        print(f"\nCopying files to {group_name}...")

        for file in files_to_copy:
            try:
                copy_file(service, file['id'], file['name'], group_id)
                print(f"  Copied: {file['name']}")
            except HttpError as e:
                print(f"  Failed to copy {file['name']}: {e}")

    print("\n‚úÖ All files copied to group folders.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    copy_initial_contents_to_groups()
```

üìù Notes

This script skips the "Initial Contents" folder when copying to groups.

If you re-run this script, it will re-copy files without overwriting unless names collide.

You can add logic to check for duplicate filenames before copying if needed.

Let me know if you'd like a version that logs what it copied, avoids duplicates, or handles subfolders recursively too.

## Follow up prompt

Please update the script so that it will copy subfolders "Initial Contents" recursively

### Response

Great ‚Äî here's the updated script that recursively copies the entire contents of the "Initial Contents" folder (including all subfolders and files) into each group folder inside the "Projects" folder.

This involves:

* Detecting if a file is a folder or not.
* Creating subfolders recursively in the target group folder.
* Copying files into their respective subfolder structure.

```python
from googleapiclient.errors import HttpError

def find_folder_id(service, name, parent_id=None):
    """Find a folder by name and optionally parent folder ID."""
    query = f"name='{name}' and mimeType='application/vnd.google-apps.folder'"

        spaces='drive',
        fields='files(id, name, mimeType)'

    return results.get('files', [])

def create_folder(service, name, parent_id):
    """Create a folder and return its ID."""

            # Create subfolder in destination
            new_folder_id = create_folder(service, name, dest_parent_id)
            # Recurse into subfolder

    if not projects_id:

    # Step 2: Find the 'Initial Contents' folder inside Projects
    initial_id = find_folder_id(service, 'Initial Contents', parent_id=projects_id)
    if not initial_id:
        raise Exception("'Initial Contents' folder not found inside 'Projects'.")

    # Step 3: Get list of all group folders (excluding 'Initial Contents')
    folders = service.files().list(
        q=f"'{projects_id}' in parents and mimeType='application/vnd.google-apps.folder' and name != 'Initial Contents'",

    for folder in folders:
        group_name = folder['name']
        group_id = folder['id']
        print(f"\nCopying contents into {group_name}...")
        try:
            copy_folder_recursive(service, initial_id, group_id)
        except HttpError as e:
            print(f"  Failed to copy into {group_name}: {e}")

    print("\n‚úÖ All files and folders copied to group folders.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    copy_initial_contents_to_groups()
```

üöÄ Features

* Recursive folder creation and file copying.
* Keeps the original folder structure from Initial Contents.
* Safe to re-run; it creates new copies every time (it does not check for duplicates).

Let me know if you'd like to add:

* Duplicate detection,
* Email notifications,
* Or logging to a file.
