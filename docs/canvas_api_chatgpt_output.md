# ChatGpt session for Canvas API

## Initial Prompt

how do you export group set from canvas

### Response

Exporting a Group Set from Canvas (LMS) isn't directly supported in all instances, but here are a few methods depending on what you're trying to get and your role (teacher/admin):

üîπ If You Want to Export Group Memberships (Users in Groups):

#### Method 1: Use Canvas People + Groups

* Go to your course.
* Click "People" in the course navigation.
  * At the top, select the tab for your Group Set.
  * Use your browser's copy/paste to pull the table into Excel or Google Sheets.
  * This shows group names and members.
  * If it‚Äôs a large class, you might need to scroll to load all users before copying.

#### Method 2: Use Canvas API (More advanced)

* If you're comfortable with tech:
  * Use the Canvas LMS API:
    * Endpoint: `GET /api/v1/group_categories/:group_category_id/groups`
    * Then for each group: `GET /api/v1/groups/:group_id/users`
  * This method allows you to export all groups and their members programmatically.

üîπ If You Want to Export Group Assignments or Grades:
   * Go to Grades in Canvas.
   * Export the Gradebook via "Export" > "CSV".
   * Use Excel filters to organize/group by assignment or name.

Would you like a quick script to use the API and pull the group data into a CSV? Or are you looking for something you can do completely inside Canvas without code?

## Next Prompt

Let's go with the canvas api and the script.  Please give me a script in Python, and explain how to set up any credentials that I would need.

### Next Response

Great choice! The Canvas API is powerful and gives you full control. Here‚Äôs a Python script that:

* Authenticates using a Canvas API token.
* Pulls all groups from a specific group set (group category).
* Pulls users in each group.
* Exports the data to a CSV file.

#### ‚úÖ Step 1: Generate an Access Token

You‚Äôll need to:
* Log into your Canvas account.
* Go to Account > Settings.
* Scroll down to "Approved Integrations" and click + New Access Token.
* Give it a name, set an expiration, and create it.
* Copy the access token (you won‚Äôt be able to see it again!).

#### ‚úÖ Step 2: Python Script

```python
import requests
import csv

# === CONFIGURATION ===
API_URL = "https://yourinstitution.instructure.com/api/v1"
ACCESS_TOKEN = "your_canvas_token_here"
GROUP_CATEGORY_ID = "your_group_category_id_here"  # You can get this from the URL in Canvas

HEADERS = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}"
}

def get_groups(category_id):
    url = f"{API_URL}/group_categories/{category_id}/groups"
    response = requests.get(url, headers=HEADERS)
    response.raise_for_status()
    return response.json()

def get_group_members(group_id):
    url = f"{API_URL}/groups/{group_id}/users"
    response = requests.get(url, headers=HEADERS)
    response.raise_for_status()
    return response.json()

def export_group_data_to_csv(groups):
    with open("canvas_group_export.csv", "w", newline='') as csvfile:
        writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
        writer.writerow(["Group Name", "User ID", "Name", "Email"])

        for group in groups:
            group_name = group['name']
            group_id = group['id']
            users = get_group_members(group_id)
            for user in users:
                writer.writerow([
                    group_name,
                    user.get("id"),
                    user.get("name"),
                    user.get("email", "N/A")
                ])

def main():
    print("Fetching groups...")
    groups = get_groups(GROUP_CATEGORY_ID)
    print(f"Found {len(groups)} groups.")
    print("Exporting to CSV...")
    export_group_data_to_csv(groups)
    print("Done! Saved as 'canvas_group_export.csv'")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### üõ†Ô∏è Notes

Replace the following in the script:

```
        yourinstitution.instructure.com ‚Üí Your Canvas domain.

        your_canvas_token_here ‚Üí Your personal access token.

        your_group_category_id_here ‚Üí Found in the URL of your Group Set page:
        Example: .../group_categories/12345 ‚Üí 12345
```

Requires Python‚Äôs requests library. Install it with:

```
    pip install requests
```

Want help locating the Group Set ID or modifying this script to include custom fields (like section or role)?
